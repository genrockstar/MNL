        <p><span class="text-amber-500 font-bold text-4xl float-left mr-2 mt-[-10px] font-mario">L</span>ong before the arena was built, in the Golden Age of the Sulubasi, there lived five brothers. They were not bound by blood, but by something stronger: salt in their veins and steel in their spines. They were the Eternal Five: Pablo, Josh, Justin, Ken, and Stell.</p>
        <p>Their paradise was shattered not by magic, but by iron. Invaders arrived in iron-clad ships from Germania, bringing only brute force. The brothers knew that to save their home, they could not just be warriors; they had to become aspects of war itself.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Wall and The Soul</h3>
        <p>First, there was Josh. When the brute force of the iron ships crashed against the shore, Josh did not strike back. He stood without a weapon, holding only a shield. He became <strong>The Wall</strong>. He held the pass alone, taking a thousand blows so his brothers would not have to take one. He was the definition of the Tank—ultimate sacrifice through raw endurance.</p>
        <p>Behind him stood Justin, the Gentle Soul. Amidst the fire and blood, Justin refused to carry a weapon. Instead, he possessed a lost magic, pouring his own life force into his kin. He knitted his kin back together, healing their broken bodies by unraveling his own spirit. When he fell, the legend says he died with a smile on his face, believing he had saved them all.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Arrow and The Ghost</h3>
        <p>As the invasion shifted from brute force to the disciplined fleets of the French, the brothers changed their tactics. Stell climbed to the high cliffs. He became <strong>The Arrow</strong>. He did not aim to sink the hulls; he aimed to create terror. Using lightning-bolt arrows, he would pin a captain’s sleeve to the mast, immobilizing the command and crippling their will before they even made landfall.</p>
        <p>Below in the jungle, Ken became <strong>The Ghost</strong>. He was the silent hunter, the counter-assassin who ensured the soil itself was protected. While Stell rained terror from above, Ken moved unseen through the trees, guarding the land with silence and blood.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Wolf</h3>
        <p>The defense was coordinated by Pablo, the strategist. But as his brothers fell—Josh the Wall, Justin the Soul, Stell the Arrow, and Ken the Ghost—something broke within Pablo. The man of intellect died, and a monster was born. He became <strong>The Wolf</strong>. He did not drive back the final Spanish commander with strategy; he drove him back with pure, terrifying rage. It was madness, born of grief, that finally cleared the seas.</p>

        <div class="my-12 p-8 bg-slate-900 border-l-4 border-amber-500 italic text-slate-400">
            "Victory came, but Pablo hated the silence that followed. He believed the peace was too costly."
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">Final Chronicle: The Division</h3>
        <p>Victory brought no peace. Pablo, consumed by grief and fury, lost his mind. He declared that the archipelago must be divided into Simula Island, Wakas Island, and Mahalima Island. The victors would rule the archipelago for one year, ensuring balance through eternal struggle.</p>
