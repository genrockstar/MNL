    <article class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 pb-20 prose">
<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen Karle reached twelve years of age, the isolation of Mahalima Island came to an end. Pablo spoke to him with a gravity he had never used before. "I have an obligation to attend to," the Wolf said, his eyes looking toward the distant, cloud-covered peaks of the mainland. "You cannot stay here alone. You must go to my brother Josue, who owns land on Simula Island."</p>

<p>"Why?" Karle asked, confused and hurt. "I am strong enough. I can hunt. I can fight. I don't need anyone else."</p>

<p>Pablo shook his head, placing a heavy hand on the boy's shoulder. "Strength is not just muscle and reflex, Karle. You must attend the school of the Simulayans. You must meet their children, learn their ways, and understand their hearts. You must connect with the people, for true strength lies in understanding who you fight for."</p>

<p>Karle frowned, crossing his arms. "I don’t need school. I am brawns with brains, you know. I know the history of the stars and the tides."</p>

<p>Pablo laughed, a rare, rasping sound like grinding stones. "You are still a child. There are many things to learn in this life and in this world that a sword cannot teach you." Reluctantly, Karle obeyed.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">Four Years in Simula</h3>
<p>Time passed. From twelve to sixteen, Karle lived among the Simulayans. It was a shock to his system. The noise, the crowds, the commerce—it was a world away from the silent sanctuary. He grew close to Uncle Josue’s family, playing with his cousins, sharing meals, and walking to school along the dirt paths of Aplaya Cove.</p>

<p>To the people, he was just an ordinary boy—average height, quiet, wearing thick-rimmed glasses, blending into the rhythm of village life. But beneath the surface, his mind was always analyzing, calculating, watching.</p>

<p>He made two close friends who would change his life. <strong>Rus</strong>, a sturdy boy with a heart of gold who helped his family in the Jade Mines, possessed a natural resilience that reminded Karle of the stories of Josh the Wall. And <strong>Jai</strong>, a sharp-witted student who studied advanced medicine and robotics, obsessed with healing and protection. They became his companions in study and play.</p>

<p>Yet Karle kept his secret. When asked about his father, he only said, “He is very busy, so my uncle takes care of me.” He wanted a low-key life, far from the shadow of legends. He wanted to be Karle, not "The Son of the Wolf."</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Challenge Revealed</h3>
<p>On Karle’s sixteenth year, the atmosphere on Simula Island shifted. Flags were raised. Drums beat in the distance. A messenger arrived from Mahalima, and that night, Pablo returned to visit him. His voice was solemn, carrying the weight of history.</p>

<p>"It is time," Pablo said. "You must be ready. The battle of the Mahalima Challenge approaches."</p>

<p>"The Challenge?" Karle asked.</p>

<p>"Each year, five champions rise from Simula and five from Wakas," Pablo explained. "They fight upon Mahalima Island, and the victors rule the archipelago for one year. It keeps the peace. It keeps the balance. Who will step forward this time?"</p>

<p>Karle’s eyes widened as the realization hit him. The training, the isolation, the history lessons—it was all for this. "The Mahalima Challenge… in Mahalima Island?"</p>

<p>And so, the boy who had lived quietly among the Simulayans, the child raised in secrecy, now stood at the threshold of destiny.</p>
