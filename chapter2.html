<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen the wars were finally finished and the seas grew quiet, Pablo returned to the Mahalima Sanctuary. It was a lonely place now, a stone fortress built into the side of the volcano, echoing with the memories of the brothers he had lost. He lived in solitude, guarding the empty thrones, his hair turning as white as the sea foam.</p>
<p>It was here, amidst the sound of crashing waves and salt air, that the silence was broken by a cry. On the sanctuary's doorstep, shielded from the storm by a woven basket, he found a child. The boy was wrapped in rough cloth, with no name and no family. A single note was tucked into the blanket, written in a hand Pablo did not recognize: <em>“I will come back for him in the near future. Keep him safe.”</em></p>
<p>Pablo searched the island, his senses sharp, hunting for the messenger, but the jungle revealed nothing. The Wolf, once consumed by rage, now faced a battle he was wholly unprepared for: fatherhood. He took the child in, gave him food from his own table, gave him shelter in the halls of legends, and raised him as his own.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Bond</h3>
<p>Years passed, and the boy grew under Pablo’s care. The Wolf, who had once carved arenas from grief, now carved a life of quiet guardianship. He gave the boy warmth, guidance, and the strength of discipline. He taught him to read the tides, to listen to the wind, and to respect the history of the soil.</p>
<p>On the child’s seventh year, Pablo bestowed upon him a gift: a bracelet made of glowing blue stones from the Cave of Moonlight, the very place where the Eternal Five had once sworn their brotherhood beneath silver waters. "This connects you to the island," Pablo said, his voice gravelly but soft. "Never take it off." The boy wore it, unaware of the blood and sacrifice that had forged its meaning.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-6 font-sans">The Secret Training</h3>
<p>Pablo never spoke of his past as the Wolf, nor of the ritual battles between Simula and Wakas that kept the peace. Yet, he began to teach the boy. First came the art of fighting—not with rage, but with precision. He taught him how to dodge a strike before it was thrown, how to turn an opponent's strength against them.</p>
<p>Then came the art of thinking—strategy, mathematics, and philosophy. They would sit for hours by the fire, moving stones across a map, replaying ancient battles. Pablo told the boy only one truth about the harsh world outside the sanctuary: <em>“One day, I will not be here to protect you. You must have the strength to protect yourself, and the wisdom to know when not to use it.”</em></p>
<p>From seven to twelve, the boy learned blade and mind, endurance and wisdom. He was shaped by Pablo’s grief, but also by his love. Though the child did not yet know the full story of the Eternal Five, nor the ritual battles of the archipelago, destiny was already being written upon him.</p>

    "And so the tale of the Wolf did not end with rage—it continued with legacy. The child who had been left at the sanctuary’s door... His name was Karle."
